### Live Demo
[See it live here](https://chrisisthis.github.io/simon/)

### Description
This is [one of the FCC Advanced Front End Development Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-simon-game). You follow 
along with the lights in order (pattern is chosen randomly). In non-strict mode, you can mess up once, it will start over, and you can 
try again. Mess up again and it's game over. In strict mode, you can't mess up and you have 5 seconds from the end of the sequence or it's
gameover and you have to restart.

### Challenges 
The primary challenge here was working with the timing -- ensuring that the animate + sound happened in sequence.

### Known Issues
- [ ] Non-mobile responsive
- [ ] Occasional double play when there's only 1 in the array

### Future Updates
- [ ] Win at 20 (very easy fix)
- [ ] Mobile
- [ ] Moar Doge-ification!
